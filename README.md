# Binarized Neural Network 
## Pytorch & Jupyter Notebook Implementation
This Repo is for Neural Network 1 bit Quantization Implementation.  
M.Courbariaux's BNN.  
Jupyter notebook + Google Colab + PyTorch,  
Python 3.7,  
PyTorch 1.1.0.  

## In Progress 
- First Upload  
1. Deterministic Binarization with STE  
2. Full-Precision Weight & Binarized Weight  
3. Gradient Update  
4. Binary Activation & Weight version  
  
- 2019.08.19  
5. It works, but still insufficient network final accuracy. -> User might change architecture & hyper parameter setting
